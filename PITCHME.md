### Disclaimer
-   As in most of Linux, there is more than one way to do things. My way may not always be the best. |
-   Some of my techniques and methods may be older/outdated. I am old. |
-   There are going to be somethings that I miss out on (arrays) either on purpose or by accident. |

### Notes
-   I would like to have built a usable script but did not have time so: |
-   Hopefully my examples will be easily modified to fit your needs |
