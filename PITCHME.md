### Disclaimer
- As in most of Linux, there is more than one way to do things. My way may not always be the best. |
- Some of my techniques and methods may be older/outdated. I am old. |
- There are going to be somethings that I miss out on (arrays) either on purpose or by accident. |

### Notes
- I would like to have built a usable script but did not have time so: |
- Hopefully my examples will be easily modified to fit your needs |
